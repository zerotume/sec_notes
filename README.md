# This is just ... the study notes of my sec studying



## 🛠️ Practice Mindset 

1. **You see the protocal? Try to get their intention asap.**  
   e.g., port 445 + `IPC$` + NTLM → Lateral Movement

2. **maybe I need to continue writing recaps ... to remember a new pattern everytime I'm playing with a pcap**  
   As per ChatGPT, making mistakes is the fastest way for me to be a specialist
   (as soon as I'm not bug-oriented programming...)

3. **try querying every field**  
   E.g., querying "ntlmssp.target_name usage" is definitely faster than reading them one by one ...
   (and more friendly to my eyes.)

4. **Tools! Remember to try more tools!** 
   **(Righteous feline is not born (very?) differently from others but having a knack of exploiting things to meow's advantage *cough）**  
   - Wireshark：Track the details  
   - Zeek：Extracting they key figures
   - CyberChef：Superspeed (hopefully) decoding
   - ChatGPT：Almost became my cyber girlfriend (???)
